# -Walker-games
There are two 'walker' games. You need to complete certain goals for ending the game.

These games have similar logistics. So I will give you the description for using only for one game(my__game). For execution the game you should open logistic.py or main.py.
After execution we can see the interface and the description of the game:

There is all the information that you need for playing in the description. If you follow it you can correctly play the game.
The second module is for creating the objects in the game. There are certain classes. Some of them has the inheritance from another ones.
